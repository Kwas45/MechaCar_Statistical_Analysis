# MechaCar Statistical Analysis Overview

The purpose of this project is to review the production data for insights that may help the manufacturing team of AutosRUs’. The company has a new prototype, the MechaCar, which is suffering from production troubles that are blocking the manufacturing team’s progress. The tasks that will be completed are as follows:

> _Perform multiple linear regression analysis to identify which variables in the dataset predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes._

> _Collect summary statistics on the pounds per square inch (PSI) of the suspension coils from the manufacturing lots._

> _Run t-tests to determine if the manufacturing lots are statistically different from the mean population._

> _Design a statistical study to compare vehicle performance of the MechaCar vehicles against vehicles from other manufacturers. For each statistical analysis, you’ll write a summary interpretation of the findings._


## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

#### Written Summary

* Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?

* Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
 
* Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?

#### Written Summary

* The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch. Does the current manufacturing data meet this design specification for all manufacturing lots in total and each lot individually? Why or why not?
