# MechaCar Statistical Analysis Overview

The purpose of this project is to review the production data for insights that may help the manufacturing team of AutosRUs’. The company has a new prototype, the MechaCar, which is suffering from production troubles that are blocking the manufacturing team’s progress. The tasks that will be completed are as follows:

> _Perform multiple linear regression analysis to identify which variables in the dataset predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes._

> _Collect summary statistics on the pounds per square inch (PSI) of the suspension coils from the manufacturing lots._

> _Run t-tests to determine if the manufacturing lots are statistically different from the mean population._

> _Design a statistical study to compare vehicle performance of the MechaCar vehicles against vehicles from other manufacturers. For each statistical analysis, you’ll write a summary interpretation of the findings._


## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

#### Written Summary

* Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?

* Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
 
* Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
